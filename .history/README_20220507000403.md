The main aim of this project is to achieve Responsiveness.<br/>
The Resume is responsive to every screen size.

* HTML
* CSS

### MAIN MOTIVATION
When we go for any job the first thing is to show Resume. So as a developer<br/>
we should develop things. Self made Resume will also show our skills like <br/> `DIRECT DOESTN'T REQUIRE PROOF`. Also we don't know which sreen size they will use so<br/>
 I made it as a responsive Resume.
